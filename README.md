This repository contains syntax for: 

Zhou, A.M., Maylott, S.E., Compton, A.M., Bruce, M., Molina, N.C., Raby, K.L., Crowell, S.E., & Conradt, E. (under review). Associations between maternal emotion dysregulation, infant negative affect and toddler mental health depend on newborn neurobehavioral profiles.



Analyses were run in MPLUS 8.6 (Muthén & Muthén, 2017).

Before running all analyses, we ran "BCHMethodStep1.inp" first for posterior probabilities for profile membership.

"BCHMethodStep2_NAonly.inp" is the syntax for comparing negative affect across NNNS profiles.

"BCHMethodStep2_FullModeration.inp" is the syntax for the full latent profile moderation analysis.
